The Bride of Trumpets is a form of music used to commemorate important events originating in The Musical Unions.
The form guides musicians during improvised performances.
A speaker recites nonsensical words and sounds while the music is played on a ospram, a tolis, and a copnut.
The musical voices bring melody, counterpoint and rhythm.
The entire performance is very slow.
The melody and counterpoint both have short phrases throughout the form.
Never more than an interval sounds at once.
It is performed using the ani scale and in the bepa rhythm.
Throughout, when possible, performers are to add fills, play arpeggios, play legato, and freely adjust the beats.
The voice uses its entire range from the muddy low register to the rippling top register.

The Bride of Trumpets has the following structure: a chorus and a brief verse all repeated two times.

The chorus is voiced by the melody of the tolis, the rhythm of the copnut and the speaker reciting nonsensical words and sounds.
The passage should be melancholic, and it is to start loud then be immediately soft.
The tolis stays in the strained high register and the copnut covers its entire range from the muddy low register to the rippling top register.

The verse is voiced by the melody of the ospram, the counterpoint of the tolis, and the speaker reciting the Cardinal Petal.
The passage should be delicate, and it is to start loud then be immediately soft.
The Tolis stays in the strained high register and the copnut covers its entire range from the muddy low register to the rippling top register.

Scales are constructed from twelve notes spaced evenly throughout the octave.
The tonic note is a fixed note passed from teacher to student.
Every note is named.
The names are shato (spoken sha), almef (al), oñod (oñ), umo (um), rostfen (ro), hiñer (hi), ohe (oh), nazweng (na), tod (to), and zomuth (zo).

The ani pentatonic scale is thought of as two disjoint chords spanning a perfect fifth and a major third. These chords are named ilpi and dik.

The ilpi trichord is the 1st, the 3rd, and the 8th degrees of the semitone octave scale.

The dik trichord is the 9th, the 10th, and the 13th (completing the octave) degrees of the semitone octave scale.

The bepa rhythm is a single line with thirty-two beats divided into eight bars in a 4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4 pattern.
The beat is stressed as follows:

| x x - - | x - - - | x - x - | x x x x | x x x x | x - x - | - x x x | - x x - |

where x is a beat, - is silent and | indicates a bar.
