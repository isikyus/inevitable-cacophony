Scales are constructed from twelve notes spaced evenly throughout the octave.
The tonic note is a fixed note passed from teacher to student.
Every note is named.
The names are shato (spoken sha), almef (al), oñod (oñ), umo (um), rostfen (ro), hiñer (hi), ohe (oh), nazweng (na), tod (to), and zomuth (zo).
