    <description>The Taupe Drums is a form of music used to commemorate important events originating in The Portals of Ticking.  The form guides musicians during improvised performances.  Two singers recite any composition of The Azure Gorge of Ink while the music is played on a egom and a tekkud.  The musical voices cover melody, harmony and rhythm.  It is performed in the ugog rhythm.  Throughout, when possible, performers are to use grace notes and play rapid runs.  [B]Each singer always does harmony and should be fiery.  [B]The egom always provides the rhythm and should evoke tears.  [B]The tekkud always does the main melody and should be delicate.  [B]The Taupe Drums has a well-defined multi-passage structure: a passage and an additional brief passage possibly all repeated and a coda.  [B]The first simple passage is extremely fast, and it is to be moderately loud.  Each of the singers' voices stays in the high register and the egom covers its entire range from the gentle low register to the breezy high register.  The passage has short phrases in the melody.  This passage typically has some sparse chords.  The passage is performed without preference for a scale.  [B]The second simple passage is at a walking pace, and it is to be moderately soft.  Each of the singers' voices stays in the middle register and the egom stays in the gentle low register.  The passage has short phrases in the melody.  This passage is richly layered with full chords making use of the available range.  The passage is performed using the gost scale.  [B]The coda gradually slows as it comes to an end, and it is to be very soft.  Each of the singers' voices ranges from the low register to the middle register and the egom covers its entire range from the gentle low register to the breezy high register.  The passage has phrases of varied length in the melody.  This passage features only melodic tones and intervals.  The passage is performed using the kulet scale.  [B]Scales are conceived of as two chords built using a division of the perfect fourth interval into eleven notes.  The tonic note is fixed only at the time of performance.  After a scale is constructed, the root note of chords are named.  The names are berim (spoken be) and ibruk (ib).  [B]As always, the gost pentatonic scale is thought of as two disjoint chords drawn from the fundamental division of the perfect fourth.  These chords are named gatal and izeg.  [B]The gatal trichord is the 1st, the 5th and the 11th degrees of the fundamental perfect fourth division.  [B]The izeg trichord is the 1st, the 7th and the 11th degrees of the fundamental perfect fourth division.  [B]As always, the kulet hexatonic scale is thought of as two disjoint chords drawn from the fundamental division of the perfect fourth.  These chords are named bidok and izeg.  [B]The bidok tetrachord is the 1st, the 4th, the 8th and the 11th degrees of the fundamental perfect fourth division.  [B]The rhythm system is fundamentally polymetric.  There are always multiple rhythm lines, and the beats are always played together, even if one rhythm line completes (and then repeats) before the other is finished.  The rhythm lines are thought of as one, without a primary-subordinate relationship, though individual lines can be named.  [B]The ugog rhythm is made from two patterns: the thoth (considered the primary) and the ermis.  As stated above, they are to be played in polymeter.  [B]The thoth rhythm is a single line with two beats.  The beats are named thatthil (spoken tha) and g<95>stang (g<95>).  The beat is stressed as follows:[B]| - x | [B]where x is a beat, - is silent and | indicates a bar.  [B]The ermis rhythm is a single line with thirty-two beats divided into six bars in a 2-5-6-7-6-6 pattern.  The beat is stressed as follows:[B]| x - | x x X x - | x x - - X - | - - x - - x - | x ! - - x - | - - x x - - | [B]where ! marks the primary accent, X marks an accented beat, x is a beat, - is silent and | indicates a bar.  </description>

    <description>The Father of Idols is a devotional form of music directed toward the worship of Kadol originating in The Portals of Ticking.  The form guides musicians during improvised performances.  A singer recites any composition of The Scratches of Mastery.  The entire performance should be passionate.  The melody has long phrases throughout the form.  Only one pitch is ever played at a time.  It is performed without preference for a scale and in free rhythm.  Throughout, when possible, performers are to glide from note to note and play rapid runs.  [B]The singer always does the main melody and plays staccato.  [B]The Father of Idols has a well-defined multi-passage structure: a verse and a chorus possibly all repeated, a bridge-passage and a finale.  [B]The verse is fast, and it is to be moderately soft.  The singer's voice ranges from the low register to the middle register.  [B]The chorus is half the tempo of the last passage, and it is to be very loud.  The singer's voice ranges from the low register to the middle register.  [B]The bridge-passage is consistently slowing, and it is to be moderately soft.  The singer's voice covers its entire range.  [B]The finale is moderately fast, and it is to be very loud.  The singer's voice stays in the middle register.  </description>

    <description>The Rhythmic Bewilderment is a form of music used for entertainment originating in The Dungeon of Shaking.  The rules of the form are applied by composers to produce individual pieces of music which can be performed.  The music is played on a snung and a ol<93>t.  The music is melody and rhythm without harmony.  The entire performance is at a hurried pace, and it is to be in whispered undertones.  The melody has short phrases throughout the form.  Only one pitch is ever played at a time.  It is performed using the slusna scale and in the onu rhythm.  Throughout, when possible, composers and performers are to locally improvise, syncopate, alternate tension and repose and play staccato.  From beginning to end, when improvising or composing, artists should always include a falling-rising melody pattern with trills and rapid runs and sometimes include a rising melody pattern with rapid runs and legato.  [B]The snung always does the main melody.  [B]The ol<93>t always provides the rhythm.  [B]The Rhythmic Bewilderment has the following structure: a passage and a brief coda.  [B]The simple passage should be spirited.  The snung stays in the even low register.  [B]The coda should be made expressively.  The snung covers its entire range from the even low register to the resonant high register.  [B]Scales are constructed from twelve notes spaced evenly throughout the octave.  The tonic note is fixed only at the time of performance.  [B]The slusna hexatonic scale is thought of as two disjoint chords spanning a tritone and a perfect fourth.  These chords are named abo and asmuk.  [B]The abo tetrachord is the 1st, the 3rd, the 6th and the 7th degrees of the semitone octave scale.  [B]The asmuk trichord is the 8th, the 10th and the 13th (completing the octave) degrees of the semitone octave scale.  [B]The rhythm system is fundamentally polymetric.  There are always multiple rhythm lines, and the beats are always played together, even if one rhythm line completes (and then repeats) before the other is finished.  The rhythm lines are thought of as one, without a primary-subordinate relationship, though individual lines can be named.  [B]The onu rhythm is made from two patterns: the st<94>l and the zaxo.  As stated above, they are to be played in polymeter.  [B]The st<94>l rhythm is a single line with eight beats.  The beats are named zak (spoken za), tuxxu (tu), ugas (ug), ustrok (us), gosma (go), k<86>bu (k<86>), ron (ro) and zud<94>l (zu).  The beat is stressed as follows:[B]| x x x x x x x x | [B]where x is a beat and | indicates a bar.  [B]The zaxo rhythm is a single line with three beats.  The beats are named ospo (spoken os), strog (stro) and ulu (ul).  The beat is stressed as follows:[B]| - - x | [B]where x is a beat, - is silent and | indicates a bar.  </description>

    <description>Cebela and Two Three is a form of music used to commemorate important events originating in the Calm Hide.  The form guides musicians during improvised performances.  A speaker recites nonsensical words and sounds while the music is played on a liqui and two teca.  The musical voices bring melody and counterpoint.  The melody and counterpoint both have short phrases throughout the form.  It is performed using the cebela scale and in the itho rhythm.  Throughout, when possible, performers are to use grace notes, alternate tension and repose, modulate frequently and play legato. [B]The speaker should always be firey. [B]The liqui always does the counterpoint melody and should feel mysterious. [B]Each teca always does the main melody and should feel mysterious. [B]Cebela and Two Three has a well-defined multi-passage structure: a brief passage and another one to two passages, a brief bridge-passage and a finale. [B]The first simple passage becomes frenzied as it proceeds.  Each of the teca is confined to the dull top register and the liqui stays in the strained middle register.  Only one pitch is ever played at a time in this passage.  The passage should be performed using locally improvisation.  The passage should often include a rising melody patter with flattened third degree, sometimes include a rising-falling melody pattern with flattened fourth degree on the fall as well as glides, mordents, and rapid runs and sometimes include a falling-rising melody pattern with glides, mordents and rapid runs. [B]Each of the second simple passages is consistently slowing, and it is to be loud.  Each of the teca ranges from the buzzy high register to the dull top register and the liqui covers its entire range.  Chords are packed close together in dense clusters in this passage. [B]The bridge-passage is very slow, and it is to be soft.  Each of the teca covers its entire range from the even low register to the dull top register and the liqui covers its entire range.  This passage is richly layered with full chords making use of the available range. [B]The finale is fast, and it is to be loud.  Each of the teca ranges from the even middle register to the buzzy high register and the liqui covers its entire range.  This passage is richly layered with full chords making use of the available range. [B]Scales are constructed from twelve notes spaced evenly throughout the octave.  The tonic note is a fixed tone passed from teacher to student.  After a scale is constructed, notes are named according to degree.  The names are imeri (spoken im), thuna (thu), arazi (ar), fidale (fi), tarathe (ta), cuthefi (cu) and cede (ce). [B]The cebela heptatonic scale is thought of as joined chords spanning a perfect fifth and a perfect fourth.  These chords are named eyo and aweme. [B]The eyo pentachord is the 1st, the 3rd, the 4th, the 5th, and the 8th degrees of the semitone octave scale. [B]The aweme tetrachord is the 8th, the 9th, the 10th, and the 13th (completing the octave) degrees of the semitone octave scale. [B]The twothree rhythm is made from two patterns: the triple (considered the primary), and the double.  The patterns are to be played over the same period of time, concluding together regardless of beat number. [B]The triple rhythm is a single line with three beats.  The beats are named timafi (spoken ti), emu (em), and úpe (úp).  The beat is stressed as follows: [B]| X x x | [B]where X marks an accented beat, x is a beat, and | indicates a bar. [B]The double rhythm is a single line with two beats.  The beat is stressed as follows: [B]| x x | [B]where x is a beat, and | indicates a bar.  </description>
