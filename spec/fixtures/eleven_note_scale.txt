Scales are constructed from eleven notes spaced evenly throughout the octave.
(This guarantees our notes don't line up with 12TET)

The elven hexatonic scale is thought of as two disjoint chords spanning no particular interval.
These chords are named alpha and beta.

The alpha trichord is the 1st, the 3rd, and the 5th degrees of the eleven-note octave scale.

The beta trichord is the 7th, the 9th, and the 12th (completing the octave) degrees of the eleven-note octave scale.
